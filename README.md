|---|---|
| Assignment 1 | After visiting UTM Digital, I get a chance to learn more about how an IT department is functioning. The staff there are very friendly, and they also give us their best shot to answer our questions in the interview session. Besides that, we also have a chance to attend a talk from Mr. Asrul, Senior Sales of Oracle, about Oracle and Oracle Academic. We learn a lot about the company and their products. |
| PC Assemble Quiz | As a person who really likes computers, I have always wanted to assemble a PC myself. Although I have a desktop PC in my home, I never tried to disassemble and assemble it back because I am too scared to break it. This PC assemble quiz gives me a chance to touch everything in a PC and assemble it back. It was an experience that I never had before. My knowledge about PC components had increased after actually touching them. |
| Assignment 2 | After attending the industry talk from PPG Industries, I learn how an IT team works in a company. Although the company is a paint and coating manufacturing company, which is not a company that focuses on IT, the role of IT team is still very important to ensure the quality and sales of their product. I also learned what the soft skills needed as an IT worker in a company are. |
| Assignment 3 | This industry talk was delivered by Ts. Hj. Abdul Alim Bin Abdul Muttalib, Head of Technology and Innovation at Serunai Commerce. In this talk, I learned about how important it is to build a solid foundation in your knowledge and skills starting from the university stage. These knowledge and skills are very important and will be used frequently in my career in the future. Based on his experience, your understanding of these knowledge and skills is a very important aspect that will be tested when you are trying to find a job. Besides that, these knowledge and skills is very crucial for the Final Year Project. |

I have learned the roles and responsibilities of different jobs in the field of IT. I have a better understanding of careers in the field of IT. The second talk is from AirAsia. From this talk, I learned about the environment of working in a company and all the skills and traits needed to work in a company. |
| Design Thinking Project (Low Fidelity Prototype) | Doing this project, I have learned how to do a project as a team. We cooperate together to overcome a lot of challenges. I also learned the importance of communication with my teammates. Despite all the challenges, we successfully complete a low-fidelity prototype of UTM AI. |
